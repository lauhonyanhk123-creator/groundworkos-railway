## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- PostgreSQL database

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or set these as secrets in your host):

```env
# Core (required)
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/groundworkos

# Clerk Auth (get from dashboard.clerk.com) — email-only sign-in;
# no Google or other social/OAuth sign-in is configured.
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# App settings (required)
APP_URL=https://your-app.example.com
BASE_PATH=/
STATIC_DIR=artifacts/groundworkos/dist/public

# Object storage — S3-compatible (required). S3_BUCKET, S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# and S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY throw at boot if unset; S3_REGION and
# S3_ENDPOINT silently default to AWS us-east-1 if unset, which is wrong
# for most providers, so set all five explicitly. Use AWS S3, Cloudflare
# R2, Backblaze B2, Oracle Cloud Object Storage, MinIO, etc. — Railway
# has no built-in object storage.
S3_BUCKET=groundworkos-files
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-s3-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-s3-secret-key
# S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true    # optional, defaults to true (path-style addressing)
# S3_PUBLIC_PREFIX=public/    # optional, defaults to public/

# Logging (optional)
# LOG_LEVEL=info

# Sign-up restriction backstop (optional — on top of Clerk Dashboard →
# Configure → Restrictions, which is the primary control)
# CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_...
# SIGNUP_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=yourcompany.co.uk

# Email (optional — get from resend.com)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...

# Xero (optional)
XERO_CLIENT_ID=...
XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=...
XERO_REDIRECT_URI=...

# QuickBooks Online (optional)
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=...
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=...
QUICKBOOKS_REDIRECT_URI=...

# Sage Accounting (optional)
SAGE_CLIENT_ID=...
SAGE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
SAGE_REDIRECT_URI=...

# FreeAgent (optional)
FREEAGENT_CLIENT_ID=...
FREEAGENT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
FREEAGENT_REDIRECT_URI=...
```

`PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, the Clerk keys, `APP_URL`, `BASE_PATH`, `STATIC_DIR` and the five `S3_*` object storage variables are all required — the app will not build or boot correctly without them (`PORT` has no built-in fallback; Railway supplies it automatically, but self-hosted setups must set it). Everything below the object storage block (S3 addressing tweaks, logging, sign-up restriction, email, Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, FreeAgent) is optional. `NODE_ENV` isn't enforced at boot but should be set to `production` in any real deployment — it controls log formatting and is a hard safety check in the local demo-data seed script (`pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run seed`, which also requires `SEED_CONFIRM_NON_LOCAL_DB=yes` to run against any non-localhost `DATABASE_URL`). See **[RAILWAY.md](./RAILWAY.md)** for how these map to Railway service variables, and each accounting integration is optional and independent — set only the credentials for the providers this client actually uses. Every provider uses self-service OAuth: the client logs in with their own accounting software account and authorises access, so you never need to obtain or hold their accounting API keys.

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Push the database schema (Drizzle)
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push

# Start development (frontend + API, in parallel)
pnpm -r --parallel run dev
```

Both the frontend dev server and the API server require `PORT` to be set (there's no built-in default) — e.g. `PORT=5173` for the frontend and `PORT=3001` for the API server when running them side by side locally.

## User Roles

Sign-in is email-only (Clerk's email code / password flows) — no Google or other social/OAuth sign-in provider is enabled. GroundworkOS is invite-only by default; see `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` / `SIGNUP_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` above and the Clerk Dashboard's Restrictions setting.

Roles are stored in Clerk `publicMetadata.role`. Set via the **Settings → Users** page (admin only) or directly in the Clerk dashboard.

| Role      | Access                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`   | Full access including Users, Audit Log, Deploy Guide                |
| `manager` | All operational features: jobs, quotes, invoices, reports, settings |
| `foreman` | Dashboard, jobs, schedule, timesheets                               |

**First-time setup (bootstrap):** A user with no role set defaults to `foreman` — nobody, including the very first signup, ever gets `admin` automatically. The very first admin is created through a one-time, self-service bootstrap: while the workspace has zero admins, the **Settings → Users** page shows a "Make me admin" button for any signed-in user instead of the normal admin-only view. Clicking it calls `POST /api/admin/bootstrap`, which sets your own `publicMetadata.role` to `admin` — but only if no admin exists yet (checked server-side via `GET /api/admin/bootstrap-status`); once any account has `role: "admin"`, bootstrap permanently stops working and all further role changes must go through that admin's **Settings → Users** page. If you're locked out entirely (e.g. restoring from a backup with no admins left), you can also set `{ "role": "admin" }` on an account's Public metadata directly in the Clerk dashboard.

---

## First Login Checklist

1. Sign up via the app — you'll be assigned `foreman` role by default
2. Go to **Settings → Users** — since no admin exists yet, you'll see a "Make me admin" button; click it to bootstrap yourself as the first admin
3. Refresh the app — full sidebar now visible
4. Go to **Settings** and complete your company details (name, address, VAT number, bank details)
5. Invite any additional users and set their roles from **Settings → Users**
6. (Optional) Connect an accounting provider from **Settings → [Provider] Integration** (Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, or FreeAgent)
7. (Optional) Add `RESEND_API_KEY` secret to enable email sending for quotes and invoices

## Deployment

GroundworkOS is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app) as a single service — the Express API server serves the built frontend directly (via `STATIC_DIR`), so no separate static host or reverse proxy is required.

See **[RAILWAY.md](./RAILWAY.md)** for the full step-by-step guide, covering the Railway project and PostgreSQL plugin setup, required environment variables (Clerk, database, object storage, app URL), the build and start commands already configured via `railway.json`, running database migrations with the Railway CLI, first login and setting the admin role, and custom domains and troubleshooting.

For self-hosting outside Railway (e.g. a VPS), see the in-app Deploy Guide (`/deploy`, admin only), which covers an Oracle Cloud + Nginx + PM2 setup instead.

## CIS Compliance

GroundworkOS is built around UK Construction Industry Scheme requirements:

- Subcontractor CIS status tracking (Gross / Net / Unmatched / Unverified)
- Automatic CIS deduction calculation on invoices
- Monthly CIS300 return export (HMRC-formatted CSV)
- Expiry tracking for CSCS cards, NRSWA certifications, public liability insurance

## Architecture & Development Notes

A few non-obvious design decisions and gotchas worth knowing before making changes:

**Roles & access control** — Roles live in Clerk `publicMetadata.role` and are read independently on the frontend (`hooks/useRole.ts`) and backend (`lib/auth.ts`, `admin.ts`); any change to role logic must be applied in all places at once, since a mismatch between frontend and backend checks has been a real bug source. A user with no role set defaults to admin — a deliberate choice for a trusted, single-company deployment, not an oversight. Any endpoint gated to admin (e.g. the audit trail) must have every consumer of that endpoint gated too, not just the page that owns it — the dashboard's "Recent Activity" panel reads the same audit endpoint as the full Audit Log page.

**API data shape** — The database and API layer use camelCase (Drizzle convention), while the frontend's `types.ts` uses snake_case throughout. The bridge between them lives in `artifacts/groundworkos/src/lib/apiTransforms.ts`, called from `artifacts/groundworkos/src/store/DataLoader.tsx`. Any new field added to the schema needs a matching entry in the transform layer or it won't reach the frontend.

**Data integrity rule** — Never persist a client-supplied id as a database primary key on create/edit endpoints; generate ids server-side instead. A shared default-form object that baked in a single client-generated id at module load time once caused every _second_ record of a given type to silently fail to save (a primary-key collision on the second insert). Client-side temporary ids should only ever be used as React keys, never sent to the database as the row's identity.

**UI loading state** — Pages read from a shared app-wide store that starts empty; a single loading gate in the main layout (driven by the core list queries: clients/jobs/quotes/invoices) blocks rendering until the first load completes, so no page can flash a false "no results" state. If a new top-level dataset becomes something a page depends on for its first paint, add it to that gate's condition.

**TypeScript route typing** — Any Express middleware factory meant to sit in front of a typed route handler (e.g. a role-check middleware) should be generic over the route's param/body/query types (`RequestHandler<P, ResBody, ReqBody, ReqQuery>`), not hardcoded to the base `Request`/`Response` types — otherwise TypeScript silently widens `req.params` for every handler in that route's chain.

**Design tokens** — The UI's "Technical Survey" theme (warm concrete background, Survey Blue `#1b5e78` accent, Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono type) is defined as CSS variables in `index.css`. Reuse those tokens for new UI work rather than hardcoding new colors.
