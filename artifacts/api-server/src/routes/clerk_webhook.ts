 * if SIGNUP_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS is configured and an account somehow gets
 * created anyway for a disallowed email (Restrictions left open, or
 * misconfigured), and it wasn't provisioned through our own admin-invite
 * flow (which stamps a role into publicMetadata at invite time - see
 * routes/admin.ts), it's deleted immediately.
 *
 * Skipped while the workspace has no admin yet, so it can never interfere
 * with the one-time bootstrap flow in routes/admin.ts.
